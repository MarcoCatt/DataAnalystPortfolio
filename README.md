What i've worked on:

Questions to answer: 

1. Find Which Gaming Platform has the most Sales Worldwide// PS2 by far, WII and XBOX 2nd and 3rd
2. Which Region is contributing to that the most// 51% of all Sales between years 1983-2012 is North America, followed by Europe and then Japan
3. Best selling publisher, which one has the most sales? What is the YoY growth?// Nintendo is the absolute winner, while having a strong YoY growth beteen 2001-2006 unfortunately from 2007 until 2012 Nintendo keeps going down most likely due to PS2 gaining share
4.Does review have any connection to Sales? // Yes it does- 40% of games below 10MIL Sales are <80 Review, 819 titles/1907, only 5 games out of 1907 are above 10MIL Sales but below 80 Review// Well selling games usually have good reviews, 40% of <10MIL Sales games have bad reviews
--Still 60% of bad selling games have good reviews// While they do have a connection its not a indicator, its the opposite, if the game has good reviews it will spike very heavily on Sales// Interestingly enough the most Sold games of all time "Wii Sports" has a 76 review which is the second lowest in TOP10 Bestsellers of all time//
5. Which year was the most profitable for each platform? // More details in the Query
6. Which genre stays the most sold every year? Trends? % of total? // For consecutive result its Platform games followed by Racing// For All time Sales its Sports, Action, Platform
7. What Genre is the most Sold in every region?  // North America, Europe and Rest of World its Sports most likely Wii Sports, for Japan its Role Playing
8. What portion of the market is Rest of the World vs Global regions on top sellers? Is it negligible? // Rest of world usually moves ebtween 5-10% of market share but in some years or categories its on par with Japan, RoW is definitely a region gaining momentum every year and getting closer to Japan, home of many publishers and platforms
9. YoY growth of every region, which has the most future? NA remains as the region with the most market share followed by Europe but talking about consistency its Japan. The most future is definitely either in NA or Rest of World


Final Thoughts: 

While the Game market has its ups and downs we can say its growing every year at a steady pace and its a profitable market to get into. Regions do play a role in the gaming industry. NA and Europe are safe bets, Rest of World is a investment. The year 1996 was absolutely huge because of the launch of Nintendo 64 which started a new era and Sales spiked all over the world except Japan ironically. During the last years 2010-2012 we see a market decline  because the shift increased to casual and mobile gaming so the market was asleep. Genres that can generate consistent sales over the years are Fitness games and Action games. While they might not be the winners right away over the years they perform the most consistent. Reviews are not so harsh in the gaming industry most likely because of the gaming community appreciating the work that publishers put into their games.
